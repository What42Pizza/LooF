Main:

add #assert (pre-processor)

add popExact interp func? (find better name)

make the compiler conditionally not allow non-tables following eval funcs

make commas in formula errors better and explain that you might want to replace the formula with a table because it's funciton argumnets

go through the code and add everything to the documentation

Finish the main interpreter
	finish evaluator functions
	finish interpreter modules

test the interpreter (even more)

make the interpreter be able to save and load environment data

make the compiler be able to add files in runtime

switch to another IDE / environment?

add better documentation:
	CompilerSettings
	challenges
	creating addons

add more compiler settings:
	change the starting file
	change the file extention

get Ridge to try it out
